# SAP-1.5
An upgaded version of the SAP-1 (Simple As Possible) 8-bit computer. Its architecture was proposed by Albert Paul Malvino in 1977 in his book _"Digital Computer Electronics"_, and a series of YouTube videos documenting the building process of the computer was created by Ben Eater in 2016-2018.

My version, compared to the original architecture, contains more memory, an input register and an Arduino board interface. This is my final high-school ECE project.

# Specifications

* 1 Hz - 1.35 kHz clock (adjustable frequency with manual pulse mode)
* 8-bit processing, memory and output
* 128 byte RAM
* 8-bit word input
* Quad 7-seg display for output
* I/O interface with Arduino
* 15 instructions (including NOP), option for 113 more (128 possible instructuions).

Since this is a personal school project, this repository will be used mainly for documentation. However, comments, advice and contribution are welcome (I'm just not sure how many pull requests I'll actually take).

## License

This repository is under MIT license, meaning you can do anything you want with it. If you want to replicate this for a school project of your own, I'm not responsible for any accusations of plagiarism (especially if you live in Israel and want to replicate this for a 5 units electronics project like me. Be careful.)
