## Contributing

Since this is a personal school project, this repository will be used mainly for documentation. However, comments, advice and contribution are welcome (I'm just not sure how many pull requests I'll actually take).

## License

This repository is under MIT license, meaning you can do anything you want with it. If you want to replicate this for a school project of your own, I'm not responsible for any accusations of plagiarism (especially if you live in Israel and want to replicate this for a 5 units electronics project like me. Be careful.)
